## Overview 
This project is part of The Odin Project's foundations course, and is the sole project in the CSS section. I will have demonstrated mastery of CSS, and in particular Flexbox upon completion. It is also an exercise in the use of HTML.

There was no set theme in the project description, so I themed mine around visiting Canada as a tourist.

## Reflection
This project really tested my ability to utilize CSS, and Flexbox in particular. It was also a nice HTML refresher. Like the recipies project, it was also good practice of git usage. I applied lessons learned the recipes project to this one.

I had to do some research to get the images to line up properly, and I am happy with the final result. It seems more personal than the recipes project in comparison.
